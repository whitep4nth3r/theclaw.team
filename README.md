This project is open source (MIT) and your contributions are welcome!

If you discover any issues with the site or would like to request any new features, please submit an issue to the repository,

## Getting started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with
[`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

To contribute to this project, fork the repository to your GitHub account, and clone it to your
local machine using git or the GitHub CLI.

### Install dependencies

```bash
cd path/to/folder
npm install
```

### Add environment variables to connect to services

Create a `.env` file at the root of the project.

```bash
cd path/to/folder
touch .env
```

Copy the environment variable keys from `.env.example` and add those into your `.env` file.

```text
CTFL_SPACE_ID=
CTFL_ACCESS_TOKEN=

TWITCH_CLIENT_ID=
TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET=
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## Set up a new Contentful space

The project serves content from a Contentful space. Included in the repo is an export of the
content. You can use the Contentful CLI to populate a fresh Contentful space with data required for
this project.

- [Sign up to Contentful](https://contentful.com/sign-up)
- Create a new space inside your Contentful account
- Go to Settings > General Settings, grab the space ID and add it to your `.env` file

```text
CTFL_SPACE_ID={YOUR_NEW_SPACE_ID}
```

- Go to Settings > API keys and generate an access token for the Content Delivery API. Add this to
  your `.env` file:

```text
CTFL_ACCESS_TOKEN={YOUR_NEW_DELIVERY_ACCESS_TOKEN}
```

## Import the content model and data into your new Contentful space

- [Install the Contentful CLI using your preferred package manager](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/tutorials/cli/installation/)
- Log in to the CLI using `contentful login` and follow the instructions

Run the following commands in your terminal. Remember to swap out `{SPACE_ID}` for your new space
ID:

```bash
cd path/to/project
contentful space import --space-id {SPACE_ID} --content-file setup/content.json
```

You should now have the content model and content populated for you to run the project.

## Set up a new Twitch app

The project requires a connection to a Twitch application in order to enable Twitch authentication.

[Learn how to get started with the Twitch API](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api).

- Create a new Twitch application
- Add the following OAuth Redirect URL to your new app:
  `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/twitch`
- Create a Client ID and Client Secret

![Screenshot of Twitch app setup](twitch_app_screenshot.png)

Add the following credentials to your `.env` file:

```text
TWITCH_CLIENT_ID={YOUR_NEW_CLIENT_ID}
TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET={YOUR_NEW_CLIENT_SECRET}
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the project running locally.
