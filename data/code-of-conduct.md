The Claw is dedicated to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free space and
experience for all Twitch stream viewers and extended community members to build stuff, learn
things, and love what they do.

We are a diverse community. Everyone is welcome here, regardless of gender identity and expression,
sexuality, disability, physical appearance, socioeconomic status, educational background and level
of experience, preferred programming language(s), ethnicity, nationality, age, and religious
affiliation.

**This Code of Conduct applies to all The Claw Stream Team members whilst streaming on Twitch, as a
participant in chat in streams on Twitch, and on social platforms related to promoting your
streams.**

## As a member of The Claw Stream team, you agree to:

### Build stuff, learn things, and love what you do

The Claw is science and technology — for everyone. We are a diverse group of tech streamers from
across the world streaming all aspects of science and tech — with a focus on being friendly and
welcoming to all. From front end web development, APIs and web systems, to data science, game
development and mobile apps — there’s something at The Claw for everyone.

As a member of The Claw Stream Team you are committed to helping people — especially those who are
new to tech — to engage, ask questions and learn in a positive and welcoming environment.

### Approach interactions with thoughtfulness and care

Use welcoming and inclusive language. For example, use non-gender-specific nouns for addressing
groups of people (such as “folks”, “people” or “friends”). Always ask if you are unsure how someone
would like to be addressed (such as their preferred name or pronouns). Be mindful that you may be
communicating with others whose first language is not English.

### Represent the community in a positive way

As a member of The Claw Stream Team, you are also a representative of the community. To this end,
you agree to support the Code of Conduct in full, and alert moderators of The Claw of any behavior
you witness from team members that falls short of the guidelines laid out.

## The Claw will not tolerate the following

- Discriminatory or derogatory jokes and language relating to gender identity and expression,
  sexuality, disability, physical appearance, socioeconomic status, educational background and level
  of experience, ethnicity, nationality, age, lifestyle choices, and religious affiliation.
- Criticising people’s choice of programming languages, frameworks, IDEs and other tech tools of
  choice.
- Behavior that could be perceived — in any way — as sexual attention or objectifying streamers
  based on appearance
- Posting or allowing the posting of sexually explicit or violent material
- Use of particular Twitch emotes that are currently associated with discriminatory organisations
  such as the Pepe emotes. **We understand that this is a difficult landscape to navigate and as
  such, guidelines may change over time. [See Appendix 1]**
- Posting, or allowing the posting of any aspect of a person’s identity or communication history
  without their consent
- Excessive and/or sustained, uninvited disruption, communication or harassment — either in Twitch
  streams, social platforms or private conversations

## Resolving Code of Conduct Violations

If a member of The Claw stream team has said or done something that violates this Code of Conduct or
makes you feel comfortable or unsafe in any way, please report the incident to The Claw Stream Team
moderator, [Steffi128](https://twitch.tv/steffi128).

The Claw takes reports of Code of Conduct violations seriously. When reporting the violation, please
provide as many details as possible, such as:

- The Twitch username of the streamer who allegedly violated the code of conduct
- The time, place, and details of the alleged violation
- Whether the situation is ongoing
- Whether there were additional witnesses or other people involved
- Whether or not you would prefer to have your complaint be kept anonymous in the situation

We will work with you to evaluate what happened, inform the person(s) in question that a violation
was reported, and establish the next steps in resolving the issue.

## Enforcement

- Streamers asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to do so immediately, even if
  participants do not agree with or fully acknowledge the behavior being reported.
- Streamers violating our Code of Conduct may be removed from the team at the discretion of team
  moderators and the team owner.

## Code of Conduct Feedback

Feedback is always appreciated! As a member of The Claw Stream Team, If you have any feedback or
suggestions on how to improve this Code of Conduct, please contact
[Steffi128](https://twitch.tv/steffi128) or [whitep4nth3r](https://twitch.tv/whitep4nth3r).

## Appendix 1

Since Pepe the Frog and similar emotes are deeply engrained in Twitch's ecosystem through the use of
tools such as BetterTwitchTV, we decided that it's not feasible to put a blanket ban on all Pepe
emotes, but instead disallow the use of these emotes based on context in channels affiliated with
The Claw Stream Team. This means you — as a streamer — and your moderators must act on messages in
your chat that use these emotes in a discriminatory or hateful manner. This includes emotes coming
from browser extensions such as BetterTwitchTV, as well as some streamers' subscriber emotes.

To replace disallowed images in your chat overlays you can use existing services such as
Streamparrot or StreamElements, or you can include similar functionality in your own chat overlays.
Replacement images may be totally different images that depict the same style of the meme but suit
your channel or customised versions in the style of Pepe.

### Please do not use the following emotes/images:

1. KEKism
1. Kekistan
1. Groypers
1. Pepe the Frog in FeelsGoodMan, FeelsBadMan, monkaS, FeelsAmazingMan, RarePepe, bUrself,
   FeelsBirthdayMan, FeelsSnowyMan, PepePls

You are permitted to use the following emotes/images:

1. Peepo (small, childlike frog)
1. pepeD (Pixelart dancing pepe)

We know that this is a sensitive subject, and therefore this appendix to the Code of Conduct is
subject to change regularly. When we update these guidelines, we will keep you informed in the
respective [Discord](https://discord.gg/theclaw) channels.
